Final project for the course "Data-Driven Economics", MSc Data Science, Sapienza Università di Roma 2023-24.

This project investigates the influence of socio-economic factors on marriage and divorce rates across 25 European countries over a 14-year period (2009–2023). Using a data-driven approach, it aims to understand how variables like stress levels, poverty and competitiveness shape societal norms and family structures.
